# Install

# troubleshooting:
problem?

# Clean Install Roblox
i suggest you clean install roblox before doing this if its not working

* go to control panel
* programs > uninstall a program
* uninstall roblox
* then go to %localappdata% > roblox
* then nuke the entire folder
* run RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe but **DO NOT** run as administrator
* it will install as *Roblox Player for User*
* then complete the installation steps above

# "I hecking hate the font!"
oh ok

* go to the content folder in the zip
* only drag and drop the textures folder into the matching textures folder
* optionally you can delete the help folder in textures/ui/settings/help as it uses product sans ~~too~~ (now we use google sans)
